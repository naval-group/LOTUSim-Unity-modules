## Get Started

1. **Get the Unity project**    
Use this command :
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/naval-group/LOTUSim-Unity-modules
```

And after cloning:
```sh
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

2. **Add & open the project on Unity Hub.**
3. **Open one of the scenes**
4. **Enjoy !  🎉**   

## Start using the Leap Motion

1. Make sure you have the [requirements](#requirements/setup) installed for the Leap Motion with the device you have.
2. Plug your Leap Motion and check by using the Leap Motion Software if it is active on your computer.
3. Place the Leap in front of the user, with the **wire pointing left** (the Leap has been implemented to be Desktop mounted)
4. Check that the Unity scene you are using have the GameObject `LeapMouvementController` activated (in Unity).
> Note: in this repo, only the `defenseScenario` scene have been developped to work with the Leap Motion.
5. If you see **red lights** on the cameras of the Leap, it is ready to be used!

## Start using the Tobbi Eye Tracker 5

1. Plug the Eye Tracker, and make sure you have the [requirements](#requirements/setup) installed.
2. Open the `Tobii Experience App` and callibrate your device by following the instructions.
3. Open the `Tobii Ghost` app and play with the settings to display the gaze trace and more...
4. You can start running your simulations and the Eye Tracker will track your gaze!

## Scenes

### Unity Scenes Folder Overview

The Unity project includes three main scene folders, each designed to support specific simulation and interaction features within the LOTUSim environment.


### Defense
This folder contains the **Defense Operational Scenario**, where the objective is to **rescue hostages stranded on an island**.  
Using Unity, you can spawn different types of autonomous agents — **surface vehicles, underwater vehicles, aerial drones, or mines** — to build and test **collaborative mission scenarios**.  
These simulations are designed to train operators and evaluate multi-domain coordination strategies.
> **Notes:** If you want to use the Leap Motion in this scene to navigate through the scene using had gestures, simply activate in this scene the GameObject `LeapMouvementController`


### LeapMotion
The **LeapMotion** folder includes scenes and assets used to **record and interpret hand poses** for controlling camera movement.  
This provides a **more natural and immersive interaction**, replacing traditional keyboard controls.  
To use it, simply **launch the scene** and **follow the on-screen instructions** to calibrate and test hand-based input.
Here are the gestures implemented in this repo with the Leap Motion:
![Leap Motion Gestures](Media/leap_control_gesture.png){width=70%}



### MultiUser
The **MultiUser** folder contains all scenes related to **multi-user functionality**.  
It includes a **launcher scene** that allows users to **spawn a customizable Kyle robot** (editable via the *Kyle* scene) and enter a **shared two-player environment**.  
This setup enables synchronized interactions and collaborative experiments, and it is **already integrated into certain scenes**, such as the **Defense** scenario.

## Scripts

The project is organized into several script folders, each handling a specific aspect of the simulation and interaction system.
The `Camera` folder contains scripts for managing and switching between different camera views across scenes.
The folder `EditorEnvironment` manages real-time simulation parameters, including the display of the Real-Time Factor, computation of the FPS, and interactive controls like the wind slider. It also includes scripts that control environmental elements such as the sun and clouds.
The `LeapMotion` folder handles hand-tracking interactions.
The `MultiUser` folder enables multi-user connectivity and synchronization.
Finally, the `XR-Controller` folder provides VR support, managing user input and interactions in immersive environments.


#### Camera:
- `CameraDynamicTargetsNavigator.cs` : Dynamically navigates the camera between scene objects by smoothly moving, rotating, and zooming. Supports arrow key navigation (← →) to cycle through targets.
- `CameraKnownTargetsNavigator.cs` :  Handles smooth navigation between a predefined list of known scene targets.
    - Moves the camera smoothly toward each target using configurable offsets.
    - Performs smooth rotation to face each target.
    - Smoothly adjusts the camera's field of view (zoom) per target.
    - Navigation between targets is controlled using the Left and Right arrow keys.
- `CameraManager.cs` :  Manages switching between multiple sets of Cinemachine virtual cameras in a scene.
    - Each set (Front, Right, Left) represents a different viewpoint of the same scene target.
     - Uses arrow key input to cycle through targets.
- `CameraModeSwitcher.cs` : Switches between automatic target-following camera mode and free-fly spectator mode.
     - Arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) enable Auto mode (entity navigation).
     - Q, W, E, A, S, D keys enable Free-Fly mode (manual movement).
- `CameraSensor.cs`:  Publishes RGB camera frames from Unity to ROS via the ROS–TCP Connector. Designed for integration with Unity Robotics Hub and Lotusim's simulation framework.

## Executables

Executable for _Linux_ and _Windows_ of **LOTUSim** are available in the `lotusim-generic-scenario` repository.
It includes the **DefenseScenario** and **Launcher** scenes already built and ready to run.  
All build details and usage instructions are thoroughly explained in the **README** and **Wiki** of the `lotusim-generic-scenario` section and repository.

>**Note:** If you wish to develop your own scenario or Unity scene, you can integrate it with LOTUSim-core (repo LOTUSim)using the same `lotusim-generic-scenario` framework.  
Before doing so, make sure to **build your Unity scene** for the desired platform and follow the same **linking process** described in the `lotusim-generic-scenario` documentation to connect Unity with LOTUSim.
